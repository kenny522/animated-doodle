Refactor Homework

This assignment aimed to implement changes to the website's code, HTML, and CSS to be accessible and optimized for search engines.

Changes that I made in HTML:
I changed the title to Herisson,
changed  div to the header,
changed  div to nav,
changed  div to main,
added Alt attributes to IMG,
changed div to aside.
  
Changes that I made in CSS:
The top portion was organized to accommodate global elements, and a, p, was added to the top to keep CSS neat,
The .headers that had div were switched with nav,
The Search, Social, and Online were all organized into groups of themselves, img, and h2,
Cost, Brand, and Lead were also organized into themselves, img, and h3.
